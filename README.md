# Emotion-and-hand-gesture-recognition
Emotion and Hand Gesture Recognition
A Python-based project utilizing machine learning for real-time recognition of human emotions and hand gestures through computer vision. This repository brings together facial emotion detection and hand gesture classification—with potential use cases in smart human-computer interaction and accessibility tools.

Project Overview
  This repository implements deep learning models to recognize:

  Facial emotions: such as happy, sad, neutral, angry, etc.

  Hand gestures: like thumbs up, OK, stop, etc.

  Applications include:

    Interactive agents

    Gesture-based controls

    Accessibility interfaces

Features
Multi-modal recognition: Detects both face emotion and hand gestures from webcam streams.

User-friendly GUI: Easy to run and interact with.

Customizable models: Train your own models using included scripts.

Extensible dataset scripts: Easily swap or expand emotion or gesture datasets.

Demo

Installation
  Clone the repository:

  text
  
  git clone https://github.com/KSRawat836/Emotion-and-hand-gesture-recognition.git
  cd Emotion-and-hand-gesture-recognition
  Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

text
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate # For Unix/MacOS
  venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
  Install dependencies:

text
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
Usage
  Training KNN model:
  Use train_knn.py to train the gesture classifier.

text
  python train_knn.py
  Run main application:
  Start live recognition from webcam.

text
  python main.py
  
The program will access your webcam and begin real-time prediction.
